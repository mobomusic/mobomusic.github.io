  <article class="post-content">
    <body>

<p>Rationality is viewed as a virtue in our society.  It is a concept that most strive to achieve in their interactions in life.  We often find ourselves, when engaging with decisions, attempting to move towards the more rational choice; however, there are some feelings that are so completely irrational we can’t help but feel them.  Where do these feelings have a place?  Why do these feelings pull us in the directions that they do?</p> 

<p>I have never been one to strictly move within rational space.  I have many times gone for the irrational choice because it just felt right.  Yet I’m older now.  I’ve seen what some of those irrational choices can lead to.  And I don’t regret them.  I never would, but the irrational choice is usually not the easiest choice.</p> 

<p>It’s safer to live in a rational world.  With rationality comes logic and definition and a foreseen conclusion.  But this world isn’t rational.  We don’t live in the scientific model that we have constructed.  We live in a world where things can’t always be predicted.  We create rational models but we live in an irrational world.</p>  

<p>How have we defined what is reasonable?  If being rational is being reasonable then what is reason?  Where did we decide that certain actions or thoughts were reasonable while others were not?  Being rational is being influenced by reason and not emotions??? Why are emotions not reasonable? When did we decide that emotions were unreasonable or rather irrational?  Followed by that being rational is being of sound mind otherwise known as sane.  Is this to say that being influenced by emotion is not a sane way to interact and engage with life?</p>

<p>I find myself questioning rationality vs irrationality as I attempt to merge not only certain elements of science and art, but also the sides of myself that are more artistic and scientific.  The left and the right brain, as some may say. When integrating subjects there is always the challenge of finding the ways to communicate the connections that to you are so apparent, but there is also the challenge of balancing your own emotional being on two separate planes of existence. </p> 

<p>As an artist I find myself becoming lost in the outer reaches of my own reflections and thought.  There are times when I find it hard to return back to Earth.  Time becomes a variant and space dissolves.  I feel deeply emotional and connected to an ether otherwise invisible.</p>

<p>As a scientist I have both feet planted firmly on the ground.  Every detail of every task is adamantly apparent.  I observe things as they logically occur and refuse to act on emotion without fully analyzing the outcomes of my choices.  In this space I become a highly functional member of society, but I can’t help feeling there is something I am missing out on.</p>

<p>So as I devise my story I feel a love triangle between humanity, science, and art will need to be explored.  There is a struggle that exists when you operate on both planes, yet this struggle is what can lead you to the most innovative perceptions of life.</p>

        <title>Resonance</title>
        <description>&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		It’s the way you move across the room.  The way you breathe.  There is a solemn quiet that exudes beyond us and into time and space.  The timeline of our existence breaks down.  Disintegrates.  You and I are left to look at each other.  Maybe I should gain comfort in your smile.  And I do.  But there is something more beautiful in knowing that whatever we are is outside of time.  We have passed beyond the furthest dimension we could imagine.  So now we stand here, looking at each other.  I’ve never recognized your face the way I do in this light.  It glows with a solemn uncertainty that keeps me focused on every emotion that I exude.  Like perspiration seeping out my pours, I seep feeling.  Pure unadulterated feeling.  And you.  Who are you to do this to me?  But I can’t resist.  So I take your hand and we dance.  I feel your fingers grab me with a soft intent and suddenly I am connected, the subtleties of your motion direct me from one position to the next.  Never have I felt more alive.  Here in this moment we infringe upon our morality of conception.  We are all connected, so why do we fail to acknowledge those connections?

        <title>Storytelling in the Digital Age</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the digital space time becomes an object to be manipulated and controlled.  The linearity of storytelling is no longer a necessity.  As we move through our ‘reality’, whatever that may be, there is a clear past, present, and future that moves linearly.  Time has an order and the stories that we tell tend to reflect that order; however, as technology advances and new ways of exploring story telling devices emerge we begin to recognize that time is not always so direct.  When we recall events through exploring the landscape of our memories the lines that define that linear understanding of time start to blur, and what are we left with but a blanket of a past sensation and feeling with no precise timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Shelley Jackson’s piece My Body the evolution of the story seems reminiscent of walking through your own memory.  Memories don’t happen linearly.  You don’t think about your past recalling all moments in the order in which they happened.  Memories pop up at random times, in varied order, and sometimes you skip to another memory before you’ve fully reminisced in the memory you were currently remembering.  There is no concept of linearity when recalling your past other than a vague sense of the order in which certain events occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Body seems to speak to the natural nature in which a mind processes and perceives the world around us.  As you move through the links you find yourself randomly jumping between thoughts and memories, just as you might if you were naturally thinking about your life and past events.  There is an authenticity that seemingly lacks in the more ‘traditional’ methods of linear stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Adrienne Eisen’s piece Six Sex Scenes there is that same feeling of being inside someone’s mind as they are thinking about and processing moments of their life.  Adrienne moves around different scenes that are more specific to memories or present occurrences.  In My Body there is deeper discussion of plain thought and reflections on life.  Still these two pieces strongly resemble the feeling of floating through your own mind. The story telling methods feel personal and intimate like you are glancing at the inner workings of someone’s thoughts.  You feel connected in a way that is unusual in other storytelling methods. You have been transported into the mind and feelings of the author or whatever character they are trying to present and you feel like you are getting to know all the secrets that they hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology has advanced so have the methods for capturing time, predicting future, and dissolving the present.  In our current digital-world we find that we can move beyond the linear nature we are so used to in our physical reality.  A story no longer has to have a beginning, middle, and end.  A story can be experienced as a collection of memories, moments, and pieces of history that can be influenced by your very interaction with that story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both Bob Arrelano’s Sunshine 69 and Donna Leischman’s redridinghood the stories become completely different depending on the interaction of the viewer.  There are different paths to choose and different stories to be told.  Again we are transported out of time to a place where multiple realities can and do exist.  The questions of what if are asked and the directions of choosing different paths are revealed.&lt;br /&gt;
Again there is an authenticity to this method of storytelling as the story of one’s own life only unfolds due to the interactions and decisions that we make.  By offering the viewer an opportunity to influence the path the story takes, the author, creator, or whatever you wish to call the expressers of these digital narratives, allows the viewer to now be a participant.  In natural life we are all participants influencing the world depending on our actions.  No matter how greatly we wish to just be observers our presence alters every moment.  These stories truly demonstrate that natural state and force people to recognize that they are not just observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the breakdown of time, digital storytelling has opened up a realm where we can begin to question our own interpretation of time within our own physical existence.  It begs to question why our natural thought processes don’t function linearly and yet the stories we tend to tell ourselves do.  Now as we break down the linearity of stories we open up routes to an intimacy that has struggled to be portrayed in past story telling methods.  We can step into someone else’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, with the advent now of VR, the concept of presence is talked about as an important element of the future of storytelling.  If we can make someone feel like they are there in that place, interacting with their environment in the same way they would interact with their physical environment, maybe we can stimulate something within them that was unobtainable before?  As technology continues to advance how will the future of storytelling change and affect humanities perception of the world?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Irrational vs. Rational</title>
        <description>&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rationality is viewed as a virtue in our society.  It is a concept that most strive to achieve in their interactions in life.  We often find ourselves, when engaging with decisions, attempting to move towards the more rational choice; however, there are some feelings that are so completely irrational we can’t help but feel them.  Where do these feelings have a place?  Why do these feelings pull us in the directions that they do?&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I have never been one to strictly move within rational space.  I have many times gone for the irrational choice because it just felt right.  Yet I’m older now.  I’ve seen what some of those irrational choices can lead to.  And I don’t regret them.  I never would, but the irrational choice is usually not the easiest choice.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;It’s safer to live in a rational world.  With rationality comes logic and definition and a foreseen conclusion.  But this world isn’t rational.  We don’t live in the scientific model that we have constructed.  We live in a world where things can’t always be predicted.  We create rational models but we live in an irrational world.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;How have we defined what is reasonable?  If being rational is being reasonable then what is reason?  Where did we decide that certain actions or thoughts were reasonable while others were not?  Being rational is being influenced by reason and not emotions??? Why are emotions not reasonable? When did we decide that emotions were unreasonable or rather irrational?  Followed by that being rational is being of sound mind otherwise known as sane.  Is this to say that being influenced by emotion is not a sane way to interact and engage with life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself questioning rationality vs irrationality as I attempt to merge not only certain elements of science and art, but also the sides of myself that are more artistic and scientific.  The left and the right brain, as some may say. When integrating subjects there is always the challenge of finding the ways to communicate the connections that to you are so apparent, but there is also the challenge of balancing your own emotional being on two separate planes of existence. &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As an artist I find myself becoming lost in the outer reaches of my own reflections and thought.  There are times when I find it hard to return back to Earth.  Time becomes a variant and space dissolves.  I feel deeply emotional and connected to an ether otherwise invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a scientist I have both feet planted firmly on the ground.  Every detail of every task is adamantly apparent.  I observe things as they logically occur and refuse to act on emotion without fully analyzing the outcomes of my choices.  In this space I become a highly functional member of society, but I can’t help feeling there is something I am missing out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I devise my story I feel a love triangle between humanity, science, and art will need to be explored.  There is a struggle that exists when you operate on both planes, yet this struggle is what can lead you to the most innovative perceptions of life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Brainstorms</title>
        <description>&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a solid brainstorming session, with my good friend Olivia, further working on the story development for my thesis project.  We got into a deep discussion of resonance and I realized that resonance is what I should be focusing on over harmonic motion.  While both are related concepts, resonance builds on harmonic motion as an expression of the relationships and connections between frequencies.  I was reminded of a poem I once wrote: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
I met you and we resonated.  
Our frequencies matched.
Constructive interference 
The amplitude now your wave plus mine.
Do you feel it.
The way the energy soared. 
When we walked into the room. 
Together.
In perfect time.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I question how I can express this concept visually.  If two people staring at eachother from different worlds can see and recognize the connection that they share, how do others percieve this?  I now must reference another statement that I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
There are moments when the wall between our paths becomes transparent and we see 
each other standing there.  We reach out and for one brief second in time we 
connect and for one brief moment I am reminded that I’m not alone.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in life there are people that you meet, that make life seem so much more grounded.  They remind you that it's not you who is the crazy one, but the world that does not know how to find a place for you.  This piece is just as much about &lt;b&gt;connection&lt;/b&gt; as anything else.  I can't forget about humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reproduction of Art and Reality</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find the constant need and “desire” of humans to reproduce not only art but also reality to be an intriguing observation.  Walter Benjamin in his paper The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction discusses at great length the rise of techniques and technologies that are used in creating numerous reproductions as to meet “the desire of contemporary masses to bring things “closer” spatially and humanly.”  This desire as well as the advances of technology continues on even in our “contemporary” age.  One thing Benjamin fails to mention in his paper, however; is that even original art is many times a reproduction of our world around us.  While we as humans have a desire to bring pieces of art “closer” through reproduction and mass marketing, we also have a desire to bring our world “closer”.  We build technologies that will then help us in achieving capturing a moment in time in the realest sense possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Painting a picture was one of the first methods for reproducing reality.  People would paint a picture to capture a landscape, a person, or a moment.  Painting a picture was used in similar fashion as photography has also been used for capturing reality.  Walter Benjamin comments on how an original and “authentic” painting has “a presence in time and space, a unique existence at the place where it happens to be.”  He argues that because we can use various techniques to date a painting these “authentic” paintings are therefore more connected to the time in which they were created.  This brings up an interesting point when he shifts his discussion to that of photography.  We are now left to question if photography is less “authentic” and maybe even less artful then a painting, because it cannot be branded in time and can be reproduced infinitely. At this point I would comment that a painting is just as much of an expression of reality as a photograph, and is still only a method for capturing and reproducing our reality.  Just because we can approximate the time in which an original painting was created does not mean that it serves any greater of a purpose to photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also argues that an original piece of art has an “aura” that cannot be recreated in a reproduction.  Again he fails to mention how the art is also lacking the “aura” of the reality that it was reproducing.  It is still very much one person’s perspective at attempting to recreate, reproduce, and bring “closer” our natural and physical world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, with the introduction of digital technology we have moved into an age where we recreate reality with algorithms and physical models of the world.  What is interesting about using this technological direction in attempts at reproducing our environment is that it is almost solely based on logic and arithmetic.  In 1945 Dr. Bush had exclaimed in his paper As We May Think, “If scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of arithmetic, we should not get far in our understanding of the physical world.”  Yet this is exactly what we have done with digital technology.  The one element that paintings and photography have that digital technology seems to starkly lack is the artist themselves.  The painter or the photographer has a unique perspective on the time and place in which they are capturing their image.  No matter if the art is “authentic” or reproduced the presence of the artist is felt by the perspective in which they specifically chose to document the reality around them.  In the digital world the human element has been mostly forgot and time and presence fail to exist.  In the digital world the algorithms become the artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of digital technology, we have been able to create and reproduce reality to a level where it has even started replacing our actual reality.  Virtual reality is the new hot topic as we attempt to place people into 3Dimensional representations of the world, however; we forget to recognize that virtual reality has been in effect ever since the advancement of digital technology.  We have created virtual worlds, communities, and profiles using digital technology.  People build social media profiles that represent a virtual self, an image that is then perceived an interpreted by others as a realistic visual of that person’s self.  We have created sound and visuals that people interpret as reality.  In our attempts at bringing reality “closer” we have begun to create new realities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our desire to reproduce the things we see around us is still in question it can be said, with great certainty, that through this desire we have evolved not only the means for reproduction but also our own perceptions and ways of interaction.  Through our striving to understand and recreate reality we have broken the laws of time and space.  What this means for the advancement of future perceptions and art can only be speculated.  But it is with no argument that these advances in technology will change the movement and direction of humanity as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Build Your Own Arduino</title>
        <description>	&lt;p&gt;Today we learned how to build our own Arduino by understanding the basis of what makes an arduino work: The ATMega328 microprocessor chip.  This chip is what allows us to program and control the arudino.&lt;/p&gt;  

	&lt;p&gt;If you are used to working with the Arduino the ATMega328 chip will actually make a lot of sense and is fairly approachable to work with.  The pinout on the arduino is identical to the ATmega328 chip.  The only difference working with the chip is that you have to add your own resistance, capacitance, and will need an FTDI programmer to program it, this is as long as it has the bootloader already loaded on.  If that is not the case you will need to take a few more steps, which we didn't walk through.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The best reason for stripping the ATMega328 from the arduino is to be able to create a smaller circuit or to be able to build your own circuit.  This is great when you are trying to minimize your footprint to fit your circuit into something small, or if you are building a large install and need to use multiple circuit boards which can get pretty expensive if you are buying multiple Arduinos at around $25.00 a pop.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Below is a video of the ATMega328 blinking an LED:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measurements</title>
        <description>&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;!-- MAIN CONTENT --&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to measure and test your signals becomes super useful in helping troubleshoot and figure out what is wrong with your project.  Wayne Seltzer stepped in to help us go over measuring signals and discussing the different kinds of techniques used to analalyze and test your signal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Multimeters are your friend!  Probably the most useful function of a multimeter is measuring continuity.  This function allows you to tell if your two points are connected.  If they are not connected then there is obviously something wrong with your circuit.  Multimeters can also measure resistance, voltage, and current!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The other fun and awesome measurement tool is the Oscilliscope.  We took out this four channel oscilliscope and decided to use it to view the current coming out of the wall.  This is not something I recommend anyone to do that doesn't have someone who knows what they are doing with them.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;Wayne had brought what he called a &quot;suicide chord&quot; in for show and tell.  This was just a plug with the ends cut off.  We hooked it up to a transformer and then measured the signal off of that.  The AC current out of the wall creates a beautiful sine wave.  We then added a capacitor into the equation and it caused the tops of the waves to get cut off.&lt;/p&gt;  

    &lt;p&gt;It is very interesting being able to visualize what is happening with a signal when you add different electrical components to it.  Being able to see the actual wave helps in understanding what is actually happening when you are adding components together.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>555 Timers and Square Waves</title>
        <description>&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;!-- MAIN CONTENT --&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;This week I learned that Capacitors are pretty awesome and they keep getting cooler.&lt;/p&gt;  

    &lt;p&gt;The 555 Timer is an integrated circuit that creates a series of on and off signals that form what is known as a square wave.  What does this have to do with a capacitor?  Well let me tell you.  Capacitors are made of usually two metal plates that are seperated by a gap.  Each plate stores opposing charges. Because of this a capacitor can be charged and discharged.  The rate that a capacitor charges and discharges forms a more logarithmic based graph. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The 555 Timer uses a capacitor by setting a low and a high threshold on the charge of the capacitance.  When the capacitor is charged to a certain level it triggers the 555 Timer to flip to an on state and if the 555 Timer reaches the other threshold the circuit switches to an off state.  This switching creates a square shaped wave.  You can then control the frequency of this wave by varying the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Below is a video showcasing what a varying frequency square wave sounds like:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transistors and Distortion Pedals</title>
        <description>&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Transistors are at the basis of amplification.  With a transistor you can take a smaller voltage and increase it to a larger and workable voltage.  This is important if you are trying to take something like a weak audio signal and make it louder.  Many amps do multiple stages of this so that the noise floor doesn't carry into the final signal.  Transistors are what allow this amplification process to occur.   

    &lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of transistors, a bipolar transistor and a field effect transistor.  We mostly focused on the bipolar transistor. The bipolar transistor has three terminals, the emitter, base, and collector.  By turning the base on and off you can actually use the transistor as a switch. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By varying the resistance you can control how much voltage is traveling across the base and emitter.  If the voltage reaches a certain level it will cause the transistor to begin &quot;clipping&quot; the signal.  This is where the top and bottom of the output signal is flattened and causes the tone of the sound to become distorted.  Whether distortion is a desired tone or not is dependent on the style of music.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Below is a video of a distortion circuit that I made:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

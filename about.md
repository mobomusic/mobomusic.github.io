My name is Monica Bolles and I am currently a graduate student at the University of Colorado in Boulder studying Creative Technology and Design.  I have created this blog to track my time and progress through my degree as I explore the ideas behind following passion through learning and imagination.  I am most fascinated with the convergence of art and technology, science and nature, analog and digital, organic and mechanical.  Through my degree I am diving into the depths of integration and rejecting all previous assumptions of specialization.  Each subject matter flows into the next.  Welcome to my merger.
